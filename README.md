# Doing is living - *a to do app for everyone*

The app purpose is to help you remember and keep track of your doings and help me gain some experience with React Native and Javascript.
It contains three screens(as you can see below): **Home** , **Lists** and **Calendar**. On each screen the user can create different tasks, edit those tasks, complete or delete them.

# Home Screen

All the tasks appear on the **Home** screen, even if the task is created in other screens. The user have the possibility to add new tasks from the home screen, but they will not be attributed to the list or planned to a specific date. 
<div style="flex-direction:row">
  <img src="./readmeImages/addtask1.PNG" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/addtask2.PNG" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/addtask3.PNG" width="288" height="512">
<div>
<br>

Although the user can edit the tasks(name, list and/or a planned day) by swaping the task to the *right* and press on the **Edit** button:

<div style="flex-direction:row">
  <img src="./readmeImages/task2.PNG" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/edittask1.PNG" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/edittask2.PNG" width="288" height="512">
<div>

The user can also delete a task by swaping *right* and pressing the **Delete** button:

<div style="flex-direction:row">
  <img src="./readmeImages/task2.PNG" width="288" height="512">
  <img src="./readmeImages/task3.PNG" width="288" height="512">
<div>

Or he can complete the task by swaping *left* and pressing **Done**:

<div style="flex-direction:row">
  <img src="./readmeImages/task1.PNG" width="288" height="512">
<div>

All the completed tasks are accessible by pressing the button at the end of the page. The user will be redirected to the **Completed tasks** screen, where he can see his project.
